// Between Two Sets 

// You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

// The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
// The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
// These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist.

// For example, given the arrays  and , there are two numbers between them:  and . , ,  and  for the first value. Similarly, ,  and , .

// Function Description

// Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

// getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

// a: an array of integers
// b: an array of integers
// Input Format

// The first line contains two space-separated integers,  and , the number of elements in array  and the number of elements in array .
// The second line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing  where .
// The third line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing  where .

// Constraints

// Output Format

// Print the number of integers that are considered to be between  and .

// Sample Input

// 2 3
// 2 4
// 16 32 96
// Sample Output

// 3
// Explanation

// 2 and 4 divide evenly into 4, 8, 12 and 16.
// 4, 8 and 16 divide evenly into 16, 32, 96.

// 4, 8 and 16 are the only three numbers for which each element of a is a factor and each is a factor of all elements of b.
